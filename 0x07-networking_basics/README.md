What is the Internet

What is an IP address
What are the 2 types of IP address
What is localhost
What is a subnet
Why IPv6 was created
TCP/UDP

What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
What is a port
Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers

0. OSI model

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.
1. Types of network

2. MAC and IP address

3. UDP and TCP

4. TCP and UDP ports

Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.
5. Is the host on the network
