Project Description📰

This is one of the last projects of the System engineering & DevOps in the second quarter about regular expressions.

A regular expression, commonly called a “regexp”, is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is mainly for use in pattern matching with strings, or string matching (i.e. it operates like a “find and replace” command). While it is a very powerful tool, it is also very dangerous because of its complexity.

General Objectives💡

What you should learn from this project:

For this project, you have to build your regular expression using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default. Note that other regular expression libraries sometimes have different properties.

Because the focus of this exercise is to play with regular expressions (regex), here is the Ruby code that you should use, just replace the regexp part, meaning the code in between the //:
